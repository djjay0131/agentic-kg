# Construction Folder

## Purpose

This folder tracks the current state of development work. It should be updated **before and after code is written every time**.

## Structure

### 📐 design/
Contains design documents, architecture diagrams, and technical design decisions for features and components.

### 📋 requirements/
Contains requirement specifications, user stories, and acceptance criteria for features.

### 🏃 sprints/
Contains sprint planning documents, current sprint status, and completed sprint retrospectives.

### 📄 spec_builder.md
A template for creating feature specifications. Use this template each time you add a new feature to ensure consistent and thorough documentation.

## Workflow

1. **Before coding:** Review relevant documents in design/, requirements/, and sprints/
2. **When adding a feature:** Use spec_builder.md to create a specification
3. **During development:** Update progress in sprints/ folder
4. **After coding:** Update design/ and requirements/ with any changes or learnings

## Best Practices

- Keep documents current and accurate
- Document decisions and rationale
- Cross-reference between folders when relevant
- Archive old sprint documents to maintain clarity
